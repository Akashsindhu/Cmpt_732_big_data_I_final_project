Final Project: CMPT 732 (Programming for Big Data 1)
Team Members: Akash Sindhu, Bilal Hussain, Sakina Patanwala

PROJECT PROPOSAL

Description: 

a) Streaming of large datasets from different data sources.
b) Storing the data in the database.
c) Using queries on the data while streaming it from the database and performing ETL alongside.

Technologies:

a) Spark Streaming to handle a continuous stream of live data in almost-real-time using spark 2.2 constructed streaming. 
b) SQL or NOSQL databases such as Hive, Cassandra and Elastic Search respectively.
c) Dash for visualizing existing data and present as a webpage.

Datasets:

a) US Accidents (3.5 million records): A Countrywide Traffic Accident Dataset (2016 - 2020)
Link: https://www.kaggle.com/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents - 1GB
Take a chunk from the dataset --about 20% of it to create a smaller dataset for testing
b) https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95 - provides API for streaming

Features to include if time permits:

a) Use of Spark Machine learning.


1. Black spots 
2. Nearest intersection 
3. cause of road accident
4. location of road accident - municipality, street, house number, traffic direction, lane type, road type, road number and stationing
5. the distinction between rural and urban areas

What we can type in conclusion
Conclusion
GPS is an essential element in the future of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). ITS encompasses a broad range of communications-based information and electronics technologies. 

With the continuous modernization of GPS, we can expect even more effective systems for crash prevention, distress alerts and position notification, electronic mapping, and in-vehicle navigation with audible instructions. 

The benefits of less fuel consumption and congestion also directly contribute toward reductions in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, thereby having a positive effect on the environment
