PROJECT PROPOSAL

Description: 

a) Streaming of large datasets from different data sources.
b) Storing the data in the database.
c) Using queries on the data while streaming it from the database and performing ETL alongside.

Technologies:

a) Spark Streaming to handle a continuous stream of live data in almost-real-time using spark 2.2 constructed streaming. 
b) SQL or NOSQL databases such as Hive, Cassandra and Elastic Search respectively.
c) Dash for visualizing existing data and present as a webpage.

Link: https://www.kaggle.com/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents - 1GB
Take a chunk from the dataset --about 20% of it to create a smaller dataset for testing
b) https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95 - provides API for streaming

Features to include if time permits:

a) Use of Spark Machine learning.
