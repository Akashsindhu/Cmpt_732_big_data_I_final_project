## US-Accidents: A Countrywide Traffic Accident Dataset Analysis

This project focuses on understanding the accident trends in the United States from the years 2016 - 2020 by analyzing it with other accident-provoking factors and answering questions like the number of accidents that happened because of low visibility and the severity of them, finding accident-prone zones on busy streets in major cities, etc. 

### Features

1. Calculate the severity of the automobile accident wrt street name or area?  
2. number of accidents that happened because of low visibility in which kind of areas-----conclusion that which kind of areas have a saturation of it----use lat and longs  
3. which weather conditions are not suitable for driving at which time of the day and in which places and how much % of accidents occured in that timeframe. How many number of accidents occurred at which time of the day, weather condition, and place?  
4. Find if there is a correlation between distance, duration and severity of the accident?  
5. use start and end times of the accident and figure out which areas are the fastest at sorting out accidents and are the most efficient  
6. which place in each state has the least and most accidents in an hour, day, month, year and total period of the dataset  
7. Which top 10 street and city has most number of accidents in US, given the latitude and longitude we can find out the distance between two accidents. If they are closer to each other compared to a threshold distance then we can find out their exact locations. Here we are considering if within a threshold distance 3 accidents happened, that location is either a blind spot or accident prone.
